# title: "Build a Weather App using Axios.get()";

text: "Build a weather app that uses axios.get() to fetch weather data from an API. The app should allow the user to search for weather data by city name or ZIP code. Use a useState hook to keep track of the user's search input, and a useEffect hook to make the API request when the search input changes. Configure the axios.get() request to include parameters that specify the user's search input, and parse the API response to display the current weather conditions for the requested location."
